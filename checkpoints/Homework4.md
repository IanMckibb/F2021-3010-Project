# Homework 4 - Individual Projects

## Section 1: Planned Features
* Procedural Map: A beginning functional procedural map generation, to be made more complex as the project progresses
* Moving Enemies: Movement behavior for enemies so they can move around the map
* Basic Functional Art: Some art functioning in the game to start giving it graphics

## Section 2: Accomplished Features
* Procedural Map: TODO
* Movindg Enemies: Made a generic momentum and angle based system for a simple red enemy.
* Basic Functional Art: Created filler sprites for each component we have.

## Section 3: Next Homework Plan
* Abstracting game state: Creating the GameManager which will contain the map, a game state (with a score), as well as a collection of all entities on the board such as players and enemies.
* Managing classes: Creating subclasses of enemies and game entities with unique properties to add into our procedural generation.
* Instantiating prototypes: Enabling the map to instantiate subclasses of Entities on procedural generation such that they perform their behaviors on game start.
