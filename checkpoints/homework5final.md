# Homework 4 - Individual Projects

## Section 1: Planned Features
* Abstracting game state: Creating the GameManager which will contain the map, a game state (with a score), as well as a collection of all entities on the board such as players and enemies.
* Managing classes: Creating subclasses of enemies and game entities with unique properties to add into our procedural generation.
* Instantiating prototypes: Enabling the map to instantiate subclasses of Entities on procedural generation such that they perform their behaviors on game start.

## Section 2: Accomplished Features
* Managing Classes: Completed the various sub-classes of enemies and tiles to make the game run, and ensure everything worked properly.
* In-Game UI: Completed the in game UI to run while playing the game, to display score and HP. This includes a menu after the game to display your score and return to the main menu.
* Scoring and HP: Finished impleneting a scoring system to keep track of progress, and player HP so and end-state in the game can be reached.
* Final Art: All art/sprites were finalized in this time to make the game look good and ensure every sprite fit together well.
* Map Generation Finalization: Made the map generate with the finished art, as well as updated the systems with gameplay testing to ensure the generation and gameplay was fun for the player.
* Enemy Pathing: Completed a system to allow enemies to follow the player in an attempt to do damage to them, and fine tuned their performance to ensure fun gameplay.

## Section 3: Next Homework Plan
Since there is no next homework, we will use this space to discuss unimplemented parts of the project.
* Multidimension Mechanic: This simply proved to complex for the scope of this game, we realized the game would be much more fun and playable if we spent more time working on our main dimension rather than trying to implement another.
* Abstracting Game State: Since no dimension mechanic was implemented this feature was not necessary, it is a very complex process that we intended to use to make switching between dimensions seemless. Without it, this was not needed.
* Traps: Though were easy to implement, we chose to leave them out as we felt they added nothing interesting to the gameplay, and again chose to use the time to make the rest of the gameplay better.

## Section 4: Screenshots

(Screenshots not included, as the full game running is in the video submission.)
(If code snipets are desired, there was simply too much code done for this checpoint to place here, they exist in the project folder under Assets/Scripts.)
