# F2021-3010-Project - Unity Game

In this project we will be creating a 2D Rougelike Game.

## How To Run:

Navigate to the F2021-3010-Project folder and download the file: F2021-3010-Project.exe
Simply run the executable and the game will launch, in the main menu press start to begin the game.

Note: At this time the game is simply two boxes which collide, as a majority of work was done in setting up the classes and background for future entities.

Note: At this time there is no during-play menu so it cannot be ended while in game (the exit from the main menu does work), the game must be quit using alt-f4 or similar methods.
