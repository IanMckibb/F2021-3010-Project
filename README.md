# F2021-3010-Project - Unity Game

In this project we will be creating a 2D Rougelike Game.

## How To Run:

Download the Game_exec folder, then run the executable inside of it. Simply press start on the menu to begin the game.

Note: At this time there is minimal actual gameplay, however by playing enemies can be seen and destroyed (by contact), and the map/enemies are generated infinitely.

Note: At this time there is no during-play menu so it cannot be ended while in game (the exit from the main menu does work), the game must be quit using alt-f4 or similar methods.
